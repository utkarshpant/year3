                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
                        <br>A "consulting detective" by his own definition, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation,
                        forensics and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic. Shown is a portrait of Holmes by Sidney Paget in 1904, as he appears in A Study In Scarlet.</p>

                        <p>First appearing in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet, the character's popularity became widespread with the first series
                        of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891;
                        additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories.
                        All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, between about 1880 and 1914.
                        Most are narrated by the character of Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies
                        Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street,
                        London, where many of the stories begin.</p>

                        <h4 id="family"><br>Family and early life</h4>
                        <p>Details about Sherlock Holmes' life are scarce in Conan Doyle's stories. Nevertheless, mentions of his early life and extended family paint a loose biographical picture of the detective.
                        <br><br>An estimate of Holmes's age in "His Last Bow" places his year of birth at 1854; the story, set in August 1914, describes him as sixty years of age. His parents are not mentioned in the stories, although Holmes mentions that his "ancestors" were "country squires". In "The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter", he claims that his grandmother was sister to the French artist Vernet, without clarifying whether this was Claude Joseph, Carle, or Horace Vernet. Holmes's brother Mycroft, seven years his senior, is a government official. Mycroft has a unique civil service position as a kind of human database for all aspects of government policy. He lacks Sherlock's interest in physical investigation, however, preferring to spend his time at the Diogenes Club.
                        Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deduction as an undergraduate; his earliest cases, which he pursued as an amateur, came from fellow university students.<br><br>A meeting with a classmate's father led him to adopt detection as a profession, and he spent several years after university as a consultant before financial difficulties led him to accept John H. Watson as a fellow lodger.
                        The two take lodgings at 221B Baker Street, London, an apartment at the upper (north) end of the street, up seventeen steps.</p>

                        <h4><br>Practice</h4>
                        <p>Holmes clients vary from the most powerful monarchs and governments of Europe, to wealthy aristocrats and industrialists, to impoverished pawnbrokers and governesses. He is known only in select profession circles at the beginning of the first story, but is already collaborating with Scotland Yard.
                        However, his continued work and t%he publication of Watson's stories raises Holmes' profile, and he rapidly becomes well known as a detective; so many clients ask for his help instead of (or in addition to) that of the police that, Watson writes, by 1895 Holmes has "an immense practice".
                        <br><br>Police outside London ask Holmes for assistance if he is nearby, even during a vacation. A Prime Minister and the King of Bohemia visit 221B Baker Street in person to request Holmes's assistance; the government of France awards him its Legion of Honour for solving a case;<br> the King of Scandinavia is a client; and he aids the Vatican at least twice.
                        <br><br> The detective acts on behalf of the British government in matters of national security several times, and declines a knighthood "for services which may perhaps some day be described".
